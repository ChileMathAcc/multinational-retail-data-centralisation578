## Project Decription

This project aims to produce a RDB system that stores company data in a database so that it's accessed from one centralised location and acts as a single source of truth for sales data.

It loads in data from an AWS RDB then cleans that data.

In addition queries will be made against this centralised database to get up-to-date metrics for the business.
